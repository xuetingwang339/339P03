            <h2>Introduction of the Project</h2>
            <p>This book is a lifestyle of Denmark. Hygge is a Danish and Norwegian language used to express
                comfort and comfort, as well as health and satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of this book is to introduce this lifestyle to those who don't understand it. Moreover, the book provides a variety of ways to achieve this lifestyle. I want to design this book to convey this lifestyle to the reader, and I want the reader to think that the book is worth buying and reading.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>I choose 8x9.5 for this book, which is the standard size for a hardcover book. For this project, I got inspiration of classic European colors
                like light blue, grey which are not bright. Also, I searched some lifestyle book and learned from the
                layout and font choice. I want to create a clear visual hierarchy for reading. And unify all the
                spread to one style by the grid and color. Also, I will use some small elements to communicate the
                main content.</p>
