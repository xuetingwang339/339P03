            <h2>Introduction of the Project</h2>
            <p>This book is a lifestyle of Denmark. Hygge is a Danish and Norwegian language used to express
                comfort and comfort, as well as health and satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p>The purpose of this book is to introduce this lifestyle to those who don't understand it. Moreover, the book provides a variety of ways to achieve this lifestyle. I want to design this book to convey this lifestyle to the reader, and I want the reader to think that the book is worth buying and reading.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>I choose 8x9.5 for this book, which is the standard size for a hardcover book. For this project, I got inspiration of classic European colors
                like light blue, grey which are not bright. Also, I searched some lifestyle book and learned from the
                layout and font choice. I want to create a clear visual hierarchy for reading. And unify all the
                spread to one style by the grid and color. Also, I will use some small elements to communicate the
                main content.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I have learned a lot through this project. In the process of production, I need to consider the target group, subject matter and reading. And start research before you start, looking for different solutions.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on this project, I think that I still have a lot to improve. I am proud of my final work, but there are still parts that need to be revised. During the production process, I did not test the font and word spacing. This caused my font to be not very easy to read. Also, the style of white space is not completely uniform.</p>
        <p>
          The building process of my portfolio was very stressful yet rewarding. In my hardships, I found most ways out and felt very accomplished when I design the layout.  
            </p>
            
            <p>I learned throughout the build process that the layout needs to be printed to check the actual situation. Because there are errors between the displays, the actual results and the displayed results are not the same.</p>
