            <h2>Introduction of the Project</h2>
            <p>This book is a lifestyle of Denmark. Hygge is a Danish and Norwegian language used to express comfort and comfort, as well as health and satisfaction. The purpose of this book is to introduce this lifestyle to more people. Moreover, the book provides a variety of ways to achieve this lifestyle. I want to design this book to convey this lifestyle to the reader, and I want the reader to think that the book is worth buying and reading.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>I choose 8x9.5 for this book, which is the standard size for a hardcover book. For this project, I got inspiration for classic European colours like light blue, grey. Also, I searched for some lifestyle books and learned from the layout and font choice. I want to create a clear visual hierarchy for reading. And unify all the spread to one style by the grid and colour. I utilized some small elements for communicating the main content.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I have learned a lot through this project. In the process of the project, I need to consider the target group, theme and readership. And start research before you start, looking for different solutions. Reflecting on this project, I think that I still have a lot to improve. During the process, I did not test the font and word spacing. It caused my font to be not easy to read. Also, the style of white space is not entirely uniform.</p>

            <p>
                The building process of my project was very stressful yet rewarding. In my hardships, I found most ways out and felt very accomplished when I design the layout. I learned throughout the build process that the layout needs to be printed to check the actual situation. Because there are errors between the displays, the actual results and the displayed results are not the same.
