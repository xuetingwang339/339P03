                <p>This book is a lifestyle of Denmark. Hygge is a Danish and Norwegian language used to express
comfort and comfort, as well as health and satisfaction. I choose 8x9.5 for this book, which is the
standard size for a hardcover book. The purpose of this book is to introduce this lifestyle to those
who don't understand it. Moreover, the book provides a variety of ways to achieve this lifestyle. I
want to design this book to convey this lifestyle to the reader, and I want the reader to think that
the book is worth buying and reading. For this project, I got inspiration of classic European colors
like light blue, grey which are not bright. Also, I searched some lifestyle book and learned from the
layout and font choice. I want to create a clear visual hierarchy for reading. And unify all the
spread to one style by the grid and color. Also, I will use some small elements to communicate the
main content.</p>

                    organic food and life. Each new edition will introduce readers to seasonal-based
