            <h2>Concept the Megazine</h2>
            <p>Tuned Magazine falls under the lifestyle category, similar to a guide focusing on organic food and life. Each new edition will introduce readers to seasonal-based ingredients, offer recipes and encourage readers to create their unique recipes. Additionally, Tuned includes health information regarding ways to improve wellness through food.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Tuned's visual identity will be built upon a bold yet minimalist design with photography driven aesthetic. The logo is used Circular Bold and cooperates with " Book Antiqua." Using the line element to highlight the organic concept of Tuned. For each issue, Tuned will use minimalist natural food photography to be the cover image and use a larger size of the font to emphasize the cover story. For the cover line, I used a bold size to contrast with the background image, and a larger size text for the cover story. Other titles follow the grid system.</p>
            <p>For the cover story, Tuned used clean negative space to catch the reader's eyes. I utilize the font" Electra LT Std" to be the body content, which is clear to read. </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Through this work, I learned how to develop a readership for one magazine and design for them. The style of the magazine needs to be considered according to the audience, and the preferences of different income, age and gender will be different. Also, I learned how to reflect the uniqueness of the magazine by name, edition story and content.  Besides, the layout of the magazine and art decision need to take into account the content of the magazine itself. I think this project is successful. But I still need to improve, for example, the content in the table content is not rich enough, and the story title on the cover is not attractive.</p>
