            <h2>Concept the Megazine</h2>
            <p>Tuned Magazine falls under the lifestyle category, similar to a guide focusing on
                organic food and life. Each new edition will introduce readers to seasonal-based
                ingredients, offer recipes and encourage readers to create their own new recipes.
                Additionally, Tuned includes health information regarding ways to improve wellness
                through food. .
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, each issue of Tuned will have a brief article introducing
                an organic Canadian ranch or farm, inspiring readers to discover and explore unique
                ingredients or recipes from that region. The purpose of Tuned is to make organic
                living more appealing, helping to improve health while changing the environment for
                the better</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Tuned's visual identity will be built upon a bold yet minimalist design with
                photography driven aesthetic. The logo is used Circular Bold and
                cooperates with " Book Antiqua." Using the line element to highlight the
                organic concept of Tuned. For each issue, Tuned will use minimalist
                organic food photography to be the cover image and use a larger size of
                the font to emphasize the cover story. The cover image looks show the
                magazine concept and fresh grapes full of life. The issue number will be
                put at the right side of the edge and can be seen when flipping through.
                For the cover line, I used a bold size to contrast with the background
                image, and a larger size text for the cover story. Other titles follow the
                grid system.</p>
            <div class="rowEvent2">
             <div class="colEvent">
                <img alt="event" src="../image/p1-2.png">

            </div>
            </div>
            <p>For the cover story, Tuned used clean negative space to catch the
reader's eyes. I utilize the font" Electra LT Std" to be the body content,
which is clear to read. The other
bonus one, I put a video to show some article content. Video is a useful
way to innovate reader.</p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Through this work, I learned how to develop a reader for one magazine. The style of the magazine needs to be considered according to the audience, and the preferences of different income, age and gender will be different. Also, I learned how to reflect the uniqueness of the magazine by name, edition story and content.</p>
<!--
            <p>Reflecting on this project, I think that I still have a lot to improve. I am proud of my final work, but there are still parts that need to be revised. During the production process, I did not test the font and word spacing. This caused my font to be not very easy to read. Also, the style of white space is not completely uniform.</p>
            <p>
                The building process of my portfolio was very stressful yet rewarding. In my hardships, I found most ways out and felt very accomplished when I design the layout.
            </p>

            <p>I learned throughout the build process that the layout needs to be printed to check the actual situation. Because there are errors between the displays, the actual results and the displayed results are not the same.</p>
